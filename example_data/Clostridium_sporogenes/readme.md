This is an example dataset for *Clostridium sporogenes*.

This directory includes:
- Gene annotation information  
- Gene name revised: `gene_rename.txt`
- Upregulated genes from transcriptomic data: `gene_list.txt`  
- Metabolic gene clusters: `cs_cluster.txt`  

The metabolic network file has not been uploaded due to its large size.

In the metabolic gene cluster file, entries like `188.0707+H` represent positive ion mode. The actual neutral mass should be calculated as `188.0707 - 1.007825`, where 1.007825 is the exact molecular weight of H.
