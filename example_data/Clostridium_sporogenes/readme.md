This is an example dataset for *Clostridium sporogenes*.

This directory includes:
- Gene annotation information  
- Gene name revised: `gene_rename.txt`
- Upregulated genes from transcriptomic data: `gene_list.txt`  
- Metabolic gene clusters: `cs_cluster.txt`  

The metabolic network file has not been uploaded due to its large size.

In the metabolic gene cluster file, entries like `188.0707+H` represent positive ion mode. The actual neutral mass should be calculated as `188.0707 - 1.007825`, where 1.007825 is the exact molecular weight of H.

"cluster_genes": "contig2_280, contig2_281, contig2_282, contig2_283, contig2_284, contig2_285, contig2_286, contig2_287, contig2_288, contig2_289" is target cluster.
