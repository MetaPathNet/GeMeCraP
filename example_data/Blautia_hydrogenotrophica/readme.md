This is an example dataset for *Blautia hydrogenotrophica*.

Note that gene names in *B. hydrogenotrophica* follow a pattern typically separated by underscores and ending with numeric identifiers, so no renaming is required.

Due to the large size of the constructed metabolic network, it has not been uploaded.

Instead, we provide the result file `bh_cluster.txt`, which contains gene clusters validated through transcriptomic data.

In the metabolic gene cluster file, an entry like “273.0633+NH4” represents a positive ion mode, where the actual neutral mass should be calculated as “273.0633 - 18.034374”, with 18.034374 being the exact molecular weight of NH4.
