This is an example dataset for *Blautia hydrogenotrophica*.

Note that gene names in *B. hydrogenotrophica* follow a pattern typically separated by underscores and ending with numeric identifiers, so no renaming is required.

Due to the large size of the constructed metabolic network, it has not been uploaded.

Instead, we provide the result file `bh_cluster.txt`, which contains gene clusters validated through transcriptomic data.
